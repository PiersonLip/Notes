\section{ICC (3/25/25)}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Came into effect in 2003
    \item 123+ states have ratified treaty
    \item 31+ cases currently before the court
    \item US Role in Afghanistan
    \item Israel/Hamas
    \item Ukraine 
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Investigations (go investigate on the ground in order to figure out \textit{what} is happening)
    \item Cases (actual trials which levy charges)
    \item Investigate people \textit{\textbf{in}} the state, but not \textit{\textbf{the}} state.
    \item The ICJ targets \textit{Nation-states}, whereas the ICC targets \textit{people}.
    \item Large amount of investigations in African Countries. Incredibly horrid cases, but still need to be justified that they are \textit{\textbf{not}} targeting African countries
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Court of Last Resort}
\subsubsection{Iraq}

US soldiers war crimes in Iraq were not persecuted properly in the military court (UCMJ), thus should have been persecuted in the ICC

\subsubsection{My Lai massacre(1968}
